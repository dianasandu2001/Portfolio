        <h3 class="Subheading">Development Details</h3>
        <p class="Text">
            This was my first ever finished product as well as the project for the Portfolio 1 course during my studies in second year at Metropolio, part of the Game Development major.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since this was a solo project as well as my first ever project to complete, I used free assets from <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/" class="Links">Maximo</a> and the 
    <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/" class="Links">Unity Asset Store</a>. The development took aproximately 3 months with feature refinements later on.
            <br>
            <br>
            The <a href="https://github.com/dianasandu2001/Endless_Dreamer" class="Links">Github Repository</a> is public and contains: the unity project, the Game GDD & game pitch presentation, 
    short description of the game, as well as a downloadable build zip file.
