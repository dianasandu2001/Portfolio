        <h3 class="Subheading">Overview</h3>
        <p class="Text">
            Bugmageddon takes place roughly a hundred years in the future, humanity has fully adapted nuclear technology and despite all odds come to a somewhat unified 
        understanding of one another. As nuclear reactors across the globe power houses for billions, the waste of those reactors attracts some creatures to the surface and 
        creates a few problems we need to now take care of.

        <h3 class="Subheading">Development Details</h3>
        <p class="Text">
            This is my third Portfolio project of my courses during my studies in third year at Metropolio, part of the Game Development major.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project is a team effort with some of the most talented and dedicated teamates ever, I am truely blessed to have had the oportunity to work with them &#10084;.
            <br>
            The team consists of the Project manager/ Lead Programmer: <a href="https://williamwasenius.github.io/Portfolio/index.html" class="Links">@William</a> who had started working
        on this project already before, this gave us a concrete start and base to work from. I woked on some background systems such as the saving system, settings, and also did all the VFX
        in the game. For the artists, we had @Enni as our 3D animator & UI artist, @Aki as our audio manager, @Sam as our concept artist & final boss 3D artist, @Kalle as our enemy 3D artist, 
        and @Aki @Juho @Kalle as our enviromental 3D artists.
            The development took aproximately 2 and a half months consisiting of complete visual overhaul, adding audio, adding visual effects, reworking most of the code to optimise and create
        a more reusable and maintanable system, as we all as added new systems and mechanics alltogether.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are currently working on putting up a Steam page together and will continue to work on this project. We have many exciting ideas of more mechanics quaity of life to add to the game.
        Stay tooned for a 2026 release date!!!
