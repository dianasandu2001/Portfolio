        <p class="Text">
            BloodBloom is a open world horror game inspired by Resident Evil 2-4. The player plays a detective that is taking over the case of a missing detective in order to
        find him and catch those who kidnapped him. The game consits of a tutorial like scene where the game plot is set and a main area in which all of the action happens.

        <h3 class="Subheading">Development Details</h3>
        <p class="Text">
            This is my second Portfolio project my courses during my studies in second year at Metropolio, part of the Game Development major.
            <br>
            <br>
            This project is a team effort with <a href="https://bbyfxd.github.io/my-portfolio/index.html" class="Links">@Fadak</a> initially co-creating the nerative and 
        <a href="https://williamwasenius.github.io/Portfolio/index.html" class="Links">@William</a> joining us later and helping us shape it into the game it is today. All the 
        models were done by our lovely artists @Juho, @Kalle, @Serhii, and @Denys.
            The development took aproximately 4 months consisiting of roughly 2 months of brianstorming, narrative design, and coding fundamental functions & 2 months of making models,
        piecing together said modles and combining them more code being developed, as well as testing and debugging.
            <br>
            <br>
            The Github Repository is private because <a href="https://bbyfxd.github.io/my-portfolio/index.html" class="Links">@Fadak</a> and I had much bigger plans for the 
        game that ended up not to be manageable in such a short period of time and have plans to make in it's entierty as a sequal to this, as well as more updates coming to 
        this game in the near future.
